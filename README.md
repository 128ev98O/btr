## Goals to be accomplished

- [x] Initializing read 1.18.30+ worlds
- [ ] Separate things related to world Minecraft
- [ ] User interface enhancement
- [ ] Improved backward compatibility with older Minecraft world versions

After some of my research about the 3d engine for android in terms of compatibility and high

I found the solution as [android-3D-engine](https://github.com/the3deer/android-3D-engine)
I'm working on it to be able to render as well as control it at a relative level
